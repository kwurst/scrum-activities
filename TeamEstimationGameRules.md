# The Team Estimation Game Rules[^1]

## Part I: The Big Line-Up

Each player takes a turn, in which they may do any **one** of the following actions:
* **Place a new story card on the wall.**
* **Move a previously placed story card.** It is perfectly OK to slide cards down to make room for a repositioned card, so long as the ordering of the other cards is preserved.
* **Pass their turn to the next player.**

Cards are placed left to right, smallest to largest. It pays to space them widely so you can easily change the order later. Play continues until every player passes.

## Part II: What's Your Number?

Each player takes a turn, in which they may do any **one** of the following actions:

* **Place the next Fibonacci card[^2] above a story card, indicating where the next increase in story size occurs.**
* **Move a Fibonacci card to a different story.** The move must preserve the order of the number cards, that is, one must come before two, 13 before 21.
* **Move a story card, just as in Part I.**
* **Pass their thurn to the next player.**

Play continues until every player passes, indicting that there are no more adjustments needet to the order of the stories, or the size assignments.

[^2]: Cards with the numbers (one par card): 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ?. (The ? card stands for "We just don't know." You may find yourself in this situation when some bit of vital information is missing. In that case, you would first try to identify the missing piece, by asking yourself, "What question do we need to answer, so that we can give this istem a size?" You would then create a special kind of story called a "research spike" and mark the original, indeterminire story with a question mark. The research spike could be something as simple as, "Ask the customer for more information," or as involved as writing a bit of code to learn morea about an unfamiliar technology."
